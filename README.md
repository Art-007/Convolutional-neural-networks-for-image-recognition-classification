# Convolutional-neural-networks-for-image-recognition-classification
# Image Recognition. IN this project we created a CNN of image recognition. The program allows to use certain libraries to figured out which image it is.
# Image Classification. This project is similar to the Image Recognition project but it takes one step further. It now is able take a specific subject like dogs for an example and then be able to depict different types of breeds.
